# Quadrature
Implementation of various quadrature methods for numerical integration in C++.
Methods implemented include Midpoint rule, Trapezoid rule, Simpson's rule, and Gaussian quadrature.
Also included is an implementation of Trapezoid rule with step-halving and extrapolation (i.e. an implementation of Romberg quadrature).
