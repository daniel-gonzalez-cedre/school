# Template Matching Approach

### histogram equalization

### thresholding

### connected components

### match to template

### 


# Neural Network Approach
### extract frames from videos
- Gaussian sampling vs uniform sampling
- extract maybe 20 frames per video, or something like 20% of frames

### construct training and testing sets
- training set should *not* be subject-disjoint in order to reduce error on unseen samples

### decide on a neural network architecture

### label data and train the network
